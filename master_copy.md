# **Yvonne Williams: The 53 Madison Street Dossier**

### *Master Copy for Landing Page & Advocacy Campaign*

### **1. The Hook (Hero Section)**

* **Headline:** Scientist. Mother. Small Business Owner.
* **Sub-headline:** Yvonne Williams built a legacy to protect her family. The system allowed ==scammers to steal it== while she was fighting for her life.
* **Visual Direction:** High-impact, professional portrait of Yvonne Williams.

### **2. The Abstract (Header Section)**

* **Headline:** The 53 Madison Street Investigation: A Forensic Audit of Institutional Failure.
* **Body Copy:** This investigation documents a ==coordinated package of forgeries== used to hijack a Brooklyn brownstone and the specific failure of public officials to intervene despite a confession of forgery by the lender’s own counsel.

### **3. The Narrative Brief (The "Who" & "What")**

* **The Victim:** Yvonne Williams is a scientist and founder of YLW Squared Inc., a company established to renovate distressed Brooklyn homes with dignity rather than flipping them for fast cash.
* **The Stakes:** She purchased the brownstone at 53 Madison Street to secure her family’s future, but now faces total loss due to a foreclosure based entirely on fraud.
* **The Villain:** Her ownership was hijacked through a "coordinated package of forgeries"—including fake signatures and altered corporate records—allegedly orchestrated by predatory lenders while the courts refused to intervene.

### **4. The Forensic Timeline**

| Date | The Event | The Evidence / The Institutional Failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **2015** | **The Foundation** | Yvonne incorporates YLW Squared Inc. as sole owner. |
| **June 2021** | **The Hijack** | **Extrinsic Fraud:** A forged biennial registration is filed, changing the company address to a NJ office to ensure Yvonne never sees legal notices (Fraud on Service). |
| **Aug 2, 2021** | **The "Closing"** | **Intrinsic Fraud:** Signatures for Yvonne and her VP are forged on the mortgage. The lender’s attorney later admitted their secretary forged these signatures on documents submitted to the court. |
| **Aug 6, 2021** | **The Threat** | Attorney Lafleur David reviews "closing documents" and flags zero issues despite obvious alterations and forgeries. |
| **June 2023** | **The Discovery** | Yvonne discovers a 2-year-old foreclosure filed against the "stolen identity" (the NJ address), keeping her in the dark until the default was engineered. |
| **March 2025** | **Judicial Interference** | Judge Robert Miller begins "messing with" the case, eventually assembling a panel to dismiss appeals. |
| **Sept 2025** | **The Retaliation** | After Yvonne requests Miller's recusal, the court moves to dismiss her appeals as "untimely"—a direct contradiction of their previous 2024 rulings. |
| **Jan 2026** | **The Rule Contradiction** | **System Failure:** The Appellate Court upholds Miller’s decisions. They automatically consolidated appeals 4 months apart to engineer a "failure to perfect," despite telling Yvonne in 2024 they couldn't consolidate 2-month gaps. |

### **5. The Wall of Inaction (Accountability Table)**

| Entity | Role | The Failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lawrence Knipel** | Supreme Court Judge | Proceeded with foreclosure despite proof of mortgage fraud and a recorded confession that the lender’s counsel forged the signatures on the mortgage and note. |
| **Helmer Burchard** | Court-Appointed Referee | Verified the foreclosure as legitimate without checking wires, business records, or canceled checks—simply repeating the lender's claims. <br>

<br>

<br>***Related Note:** Burchard was named in the NY Post for allegedly bribing Judge Knipel (though not directly cited as a mechanic of this specific case).* |
| **Eric Gonzalez** | Brooklyn DA | Refused to bring criminal charges despite forensic proof of forgery and a direct admission of the crime by the lender’s attorney. |
| **Letitia James** | NY Attorney General | Declined to intervene on Case #531361, citing a "conflict of interest" while the institutional theft of the property proceeded. |

### **6. The Evidence Inventory (The Receipts)**

* **Exhibit A (The Address Switch):** On June 29, 2021, the corporation's address was fraudulently changed to Montvale, NJ—ensuring Yvonne never saw a single legal notice.
* **Exhibit B (The Forgery Confession):** Recorded admission where the lender's attorney stated their secretary forged Yvonne's signature on the mortgage and note to commence the foreclosure.
* **Exhibit C (The $15,000 Theft):** At the August 2, 2021 closing, ==National Standard Abstract (NSA)==—specifically representative ==Paul Interlandi==—knowingly collected an illegal 'Mansion Tax' on a 6-unit property where the tax is legally impossible. This ==$15,000== was part of a coordinated package of 'stolen fees' that vanished at the closing table.
* **Exhibit D (The Factory of Fraud):** We have documented over 100 instances of forged signatures within a single closing binder, proving a coordinated effort to steal 53 Madison Street through sheer repetition of criminal acts.

### **7. The Call to Action (The Primary Target)**

* **Headline:** The community is watching. Do not add your name to the list of officials who did nothing.
* **The Ask:** Demand that Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest and Senator Jabari Brisport launch a formal inquiry into the "Pay-to-Play" appointments and the fraudulent foreclosure of 53 Madison Street.
* **Button Text:** "Demand Justice — Contact Your Reps."
